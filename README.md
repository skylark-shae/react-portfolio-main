# Skylar Shae Portfolio with React

## Description

This project is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my background, skills, and projects as I transition into the tech industry. Built to highlight my experience in accounting, IT oversight, and retail management, this portfolio also reflects my ongoing journey through the University of Oregon Full Stack Development Bootcamp. The site features sections on my education, professional experience, and coding projects, demonstrating my growth in web development and my commitment to learning. This portfolio serves as both a personal introduction and a testament to my dedication to entering and contributing to the field of Computer Science.

## Usage
### User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position```

### Acceptance Criteria 

```md
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)

- Add projects as available and continue developing skills.
- Correct faChecks to all remain the same size. Issue persisting in "Personal Experience".

## Credits
I designed this with the help from a work associate, Sparrow Rossberg, who works with react and TypeScript She assisted with creating a basic file structure and helped troubleshoot issues as they came up. Despite her telling me it is unneeded to directly attribute her I felt it was disingenuous to post this project without her name being on it for helping a large amount.

I also found design inspiration from other github users, despite being careful to avoid using code for identical implementations their projects and portfolios were integral in helping me figure out a design and how to implement some elements.
